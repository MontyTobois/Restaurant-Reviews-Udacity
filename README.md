### Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, I turned the static pages into responsive ones. Now usable on a desktop browser, plus a mobile device. It also has included the standard accessibility features, and it does work offline now. Your job is to pick from the finest Restaurants offered in the area.

## Language

This project is built with **HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT.**

## Setup

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the new updates look like.
